# Homework 3:

Worked with Liam Kelley, Shea Fitzgerald, Michael Richardson and Ben Sails

I worked on the Z tes lab by myself; I helped Shea a little bit with it on what were the instructions to do it.

For the KS- Test, I did the execution of the file, sorting it into the values of data that we wanted, convert the date and time into a single
column and into datetime type. I also found the rows with datetime issues and deiced to delete them

Worked with Liam to broadcast eqGoodData. He helped understand the process and to then be able to do the gap column, as well as we helped Michael and Ben with the first part of the 
KS-Test

Worked with Liam and Shea in the data exploration and data analysis. I used a lot of help from them in the data analaysis part which was the most 
challenging part for me.

Finally, worked with Liam to write the discussion.
