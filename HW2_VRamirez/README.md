# Homework 2

I worked on the homework with Liam Kelly in the first part of Homework2_2, with the chi squared and the Poisson distribution.
Liam helped me understand the syntaxes of the code and the functioning of the random functions for the distributions. 
I helped Liam with the Homewor2_1 in helping understand the Maxwell-Boltzamn Distribution and its parameters, and we both worked together 
to determine the mean for each degree of freedom.

The rest of the Homework I worked on it by myself, doing the rest of the distributions, analyzing their meaning and how they vary from each other
I also worked on finding how to make the random.special.binomial function parameters to work because I had issues with it.
Finally, I researched on scipy about how the gamma distribution works and picked it as the last distribution.
